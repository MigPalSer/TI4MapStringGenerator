What is this?

 Non profitable map generator. We give you different templates, you select the type of map and we offer you a link to the keeganw (***include link) map creator (which is awesome to us) for visualice and the string for TTS

How the algorythm works?
 Template, fix hexagons and providers randomized

Which is the difference for Random, Balanced and Conflictive?

I have a perfect idea/suggestion/template...
