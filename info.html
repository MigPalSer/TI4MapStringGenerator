What is this?

 Non profitable map generator. We give you different templates, you select the type of map and we offer you a link to the keeganw (***include link) map creator (which is awesome to us) for visualice and the string for TTS

How the algorythm works?
 Template, fix hexagons and providers randomized
 We link templates (distributions of the map) with modes (random, balanced and conflictive); each of those combinations is a template object with fix hexagons (for example, usually Mecatol Rex at center) and variable hexagons of certain type (blue or red hexagons).
We use some "providers" of hexagons, you can imagine as a pile of hexagons of a certain type shuffled, and the process consists in iterate the template and fill the variable hexagon places with hexagons of the providers. 

Which is the difference for Random, Balanced and Conflictive?

All the three modes use the same basic structure of the map (with certain hexagons in fix places and red and blue positions) but they differ in the way they complete the blue positions.
Random mode shuffle all the unused blue hexagons and distribute randomly, which causes more unbalanced maps.

I have a perfect idea/suggestion/template...
