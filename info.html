What is this?

 Non profitable map generator. We give you different templates, you select the type of map and we offer you a link to the keeganw (***include link) map creator (which is awesome to us) for visualice and the string for TTS

How the algorythm works?
 Template, fix hexagons and providers randomized
 We link templates (distributions of the map) with modes (random, balanced and conflictive); each of those combinations is a template object with fix hexagons (for example, usually Mecatol Rex at center) and variable hexagons of certain type (blue or red hexagons).
We use some "providers" of hexagons, you can imagine as a pile of hexagons of a certain type shuffled, and the process consists in iterate the template and fill the variable hexagon places with hexagons of the providers. 

Which is the difference for Random, Balanced and Conflictive?

All the three modes use the same basic structure of the map (with certain hexagons in fix places and red and blue positions) but they differ in the way they complete the blue positions.
Random mode shuffle all the unused blue hexagons and distribute randomly, which causes more unbalanced maps. For the other two modes, we divide the blue hexagons in three sets in function of their quality (resources, influence, tech...) and asign a certain set to each tile of the template.
The balanced mode uses a distribution with the most valuable systems in close positions to the home systems and place less value hexagons in the disputated areas.
Conflictive mode is the opposite; in conflictive templates we place the most value systems in the disputed areas and left the less value ones to the peaceful zones.
Both modes create more balanced maps than random but differ in the incentives of conflict.
